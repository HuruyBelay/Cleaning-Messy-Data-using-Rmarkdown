# Cleaning Messy Data using Rmarkdown

We will work with attendance data from public schools in the US, organized by school level and state, during the 2007-2008 academic year. The data contain information on average daily attendance (ADA) as a percentage of total enrollment, school day length, and school year length.

I got the data from Datacamp training course.

We can [view](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1294/datasets/attendance_screenshot.png) a screenshot of the data.
